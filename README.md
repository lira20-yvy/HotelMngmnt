#### Video Demo:https://youtu.be/G14AP7SXWUc?si=RMF3Oo0ayJIv-Gia
#### Description: This semestral project which is a Simple Hotel Management System gives some simple insight about how hotels accommodate some guests or clients. In my code, The first thing to do is to have a reservation dorm/ details of the guest and then proceed to the available rooms, day tour package and also foods that the guest can reserve. The main function of this code is just that, displaying the main menu together with collecting the guest information and choices. It also manages the room, packages and foods prepared for the guest. To make it more good looking, it also has a simple receipt and guest feedback. I also include some imports like termcolor and random to make it more user friendly and appealing. All with this, The knowledge I gained abot=ut this course and this project will remain and will contribute to my growth.
